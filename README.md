## A Fully Open-Source Nasometer

**Nosey MEMS** is the first direct upgrade of **Nosey** ([Github](https://github.com/phoneticslab/nosey), [Paper IS25](https://www.isca-archive.org/interspeech_2025/dewhurst25_interspeech.pdf)), the open-source hardware for acoustic nasalance.

Nosey MEMS includes a fully open-source **KiCad9 schematic and PCB**, along with all production files. The design focuses on being **simple, low-cost, low-maintenance**, yet (hopefully) effective research-grade microphones.

It is specifically designed for **measuring nasalance**, but the schematic and/or PCB can be edited to fit any desired function.

***Still under heavy development.***

## TODO:
- Verify circuit schematic is optimal for this stage, given the design restrictions
- Send a test batch for manufacturing and assembly (verify quality of assembly)
- Basic verification of the device (i.e. ease of assembly, ease of use, quality of operation, ...)
- Make new 3D model to support the new device (test 3D printing, test fit PCB into print, test performance, ergonomics, ...)
- Advanced verification of the device (i.e. MEMS mic frequency response, circuit stability, ...)
- Write a new paper about it :)
