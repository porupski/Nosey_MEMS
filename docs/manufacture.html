                        <p>This guide will walk you through the complete manufacturing process for the Nosey MEMS Nasometer, from ordering PCBs to final assembly and testing.</p>

                        <p>Currently, the full PCB manufacturing and assembly has only been tried via JLCPCB. All present information is for their specific ordering steps. If you are using a different manufacturer (or even this one at a later date), please adjust accordingly!</p>

                        <p>All the files required for manufacture will be available at the GitHub repo after quality control.</p>

                        <p>Nosey MEMS is designed to be manufactured as simply, as easily, and as cheaply as possible.</p> 
                        <ul>
                            <li>The PCB is less than 100x100mm (88x60mm) in size, keeping the PCB manufacturing cost low as well as the final device footprint.</li>
                            <li>Assembly is only done on the Top layer, simplifying the process.</li>
                            <li>All components, excluding the XLR3 audio jacks, are assembled for us, minimizing post-assembly additional work.</li>
                            <li>Automatic assembly allows us to pick smaller part packages, lowering the parts cost and allowing for a smaller footprint, albeit with a possible increase in difficulty for manual rework.</li>
                            <li>The use of MEMS microphones allows us to circumvent a lot of obstacles in microphone design and manufacture—from sourcing parts to soldering—while keeping the cost low at an acceptable frequency range.</li>
                        </ul>

                        <h3>Getting the Production Files</h3>

                        <p>Go to <a href="index.html#downloads">Downloads</a> and download the <b>production</b> folder. Inside there are:
                            <ul>
                                <li>the <b>.zip file</b> containing the PCB Gerber files,</li>
                                <li>the <b>bom.csv</b> file containing the Bill of Materials, and</li>
                                <li>the <b>positions.csv</b> file containing the component placements.</li>
                            </ul>
                        All three are <b>critical</b> for manufacture.</p>

                        <p>Find a PCB fabrication and component assembly manufacturer and follow the general ordering process. The rest of the guide will be referencing the process of a particular manufacturer.</p>

                            <p>If the manufacturer's viewer doesn't show the model for the MEMS microphones (MK1, MK2), the manufacturer should resolve this. Otherwise, a soldering station and advanced SMD soldering skills will be needed to solder on the MEMS microphones.</p>
                            <p>If a component is placed in the wrong orientation, the manufacturer typically runs a Design for manufacturability (DFM) analysis to catch such mistakes. While this provides a useful safety net, it's best practice to ensure all components are oriented correctly before submitting the design.</p>

                            This concludes the ordering process. If all went well, your Nosey MEMS is being manufactured and you will receive it fully and properly assembled. When it arrives, move to <a href="#soldering-sec">Soldering</a>.

                            <p>The only components that have to be soldered upon receiving the finished board are the two XLR3 audio jacks.</p>

                            <p>
                                <ul>
                                    <li>Place the audio jacks on their designated place on the PCB (J1, J2), as seen in <a href="#pcb_assembly_placement">Figure 2</a> (coming soon).</li>
                                    <li>Solder the joints with solder and flux.</li>
                                    <li>Verify all connections are mechanically and electronically sound.</li>
                                    <li>Move to Testing and Verification.</li>

                                Alternatively, should sourcing the jacks be difficult or there isn't a need for jacks, one may solder the audio cable directly to the PCB, provided additional reinforcments are made to the cable (potencially zip-tied to the 3D printed Housing?).

                                    <li>First, visually inspect the board. Is it neat? Is it clean? Are all the parts neatly placed and soldered? Are any crooked? Are all component making electrical contact? Does any component look damaged? Are all the polarized components (diodes, capacitors, amps) correctly oriented?</li>
                                    <li>Second, <b>turn off Phantom power (48V)</b> and, provdided the board is up to standard, connect <b>only one</b> of the two channels the Nosey MEMS to an audio capture card with a shielded balanced XLR cable. Verify there are no sounds coming from the Nosey MEMS, as it is not yet powered.</li>
                                    <li>Third, <b>set the gain to zero</b> before turning on Phantom power (48V).</li>
                                    <li>Fourth, <b>slowly increase the grain</b>, making sure there is no feedback or irregular sounds, try talking into the MEMS microphone of the connected channel. You should hear yourself clearly, with no distorsion, delay or artefacts.</li>
                                    <li>Fifth, repeat the process for the other channel and verify that both are working correctly and equally well.</li>
