                        <p><b>Nosey MEMS</b> is a <b>fully open-source nasometer</b>, a device used to measure the acoustic energy simultaneously from both the oral and nasal cavities produced during speech. This type of study is most commonly studied within the field of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Articulatory_phonetics">Articulatory Phonetics</a>.</p>

                        <p><b>Nosey MEMS</b> is the first direct upgrade of <a href="https://www.isca-archive.org/interspeech_2025/dewhurst25_interspeech.pdf"><b>Nosey</b></a>, the open-source hardware for acoustic nasalance, developed by <a href="https://github.com/phoneticslab/nosey">Lancaster University Phonetics lab</a>.</p>

                        <h3>Key Features</h3>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Stereo MEMS (micro-electromechanical systems) Microphone</li>
                            <li>Frequency response: 100 Hz - 10 kHz* to be checked later</li>
                            <li>Runs on Phantom power +48V, XLR3 jacks</li>
                            <li>Open-source KiCad 9.0 schematic, PCB and assembly files available</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>* This is a typical MEMS microphone frequency response. Frequency response will always vary from microphone to microphone, even within the same production batch. Calibration is higly suggested.</p>

                        <h3>Circuit Overview</h3>

                        <ul>
                            <li>Circuit is designed to be simple, low-cost yet effective as a nasalance instrument. Can be adapted to function as a stereo microphone with custom power, custom capsule, etc.</li>
                            <li>Utilizes MEMS microphone to avoid the need for 1G ohm resistors, but also allows fully automatic assembly of the PCB, while maintaining respectable frequency response.</li>
                            <li>Dual OPA1652 Low Noise amplifiers are used as a differential inverting amplifier. Low current, low noise, and the double inverting topology allows the setting of gain if so needed (make sure they match).</li>
                            <li>Power supply consists of a bank of capacitors with an 18V Zener diode, followed by a CMOS LDO PJ71k50 which provides the stable 5V supply for the OPA1652, as well as the virtual ground (V/2) using a voltage divider.</li>
                        </ul>

                        <h3>PCB Overview</h3>


                        <ul>
                            <li>Small form factor, slides into the new Nosey v2 3D printed model. PETG is recommended for durability and better water resistance.</li>
                            <li>Two XLR3 jacks run from the side down, staying out of the way and allowing easier cabel managment, while providing ample structural support. The metal shielding connects to the PCB via the XLR3's ground connection in the bottom right screw hole. Optional bypassing of the shield to ground is possible via soldering across JP1.</li>
                            <li>The tall electrolytic capacitor's topology was used to create a barrier between the two MEMS microphones, (hopefully) reducing cross-contamination.</li>
                            <li>Open-source Nosey v2 3D model files available at __(well not yet!)__.</li>
                        </ul>

                        <h3>3D Model (v2) Overview</h3>
                        <ul>
                            <li>A new, fully 3D-printable Baffle, Handle and Housing* models.</li>
                            * Aluminium tape (or equivalent) will be required.
                            <li>The microphone preamp PCB slides into the new design, followed by two screws on the top corners and four screws for the two XLR3 jacks (make sure to install the screws which are connected to the shield!), securely mounting it to the 3D printed parts.</li>
                            <li>The Housing requires preparation. To shield the delicate circuitry from electromagnetic interferance,it is necessary to properly shield the microphone preamp. The Housing was designed to be covered in electrically conductive tape on the inside (make sure the overlaping tape makes electrical contact!), finally connecting via the two XLR3's shielding screws to the circuit in large. This step is critical for getting acceptable performance. DETAILED GUIDE TO FOLLOW.</li>
                            <li>[WORK IN PROGRESS] The PCB hasn't even existed yet! (24sep2025)</li>

                            Inside the GitHub repo you will find a .zip file containing Gerber files necessary for PCB Manufacturing. However, please do note these are specifically tailor-made to JLCPCB as this was the manufacturer I used.

                        <p>
                            Upon recieving the assembled PCBs, the only soldering that is necessary is to solder on the two XLR3 audio jacks on the sides, pointing downwards.

                        <h2>Calibration</h2>
                        <p>Given the MEMS microphones come pre-assembled for us, a calibration test is recommended to make sure the device provides accurate measurements.</p>

                        <p>
                            <a href="https://www.roomeqwizard.com/">Room EQ Wizard</a> (REW) is an open-source software package for acoustical measurements. It is commonly used for measuring acoustic of a room, frequency response of speakers and microphones, but also (pre)amplifier circuits.
                        </p>
                        <p>Available for Windows, macOS and Linux.</p>
                        
                        <h3>General steps for calibrating Nosey v2:</h3>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Connect both Nosey MEMS channels to an audio card (pre-calibrated with REW, Phantom Power +48V on) and verify the microphones are working.</li>
                            <li>Mount Nosey MEMS about 5cm from a loudspeaker (ideally calibrated studio monitor).</li>
                            <li>Run REW frequency sweep for each microphone.</li>
                            <li>Compare the frequency response curves to verify if the microphones match up sufficiently for your reasearch purposes.</li>
                            <li>Optional: Use these reponse curves to filter your raw audio before nasalance calucations.</li>
