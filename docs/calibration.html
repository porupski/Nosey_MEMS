    <h2>Starting off right</h2>
    
    <p>This guide covers the validation and calibration process for the Nosey MEMS Nasometer using Room EQ Wizard (REW).</p>
    
    <p>
        <a href="https://www.roomeqwizard.com/" target="_blank">Room EQ Wizard</a> (REW) is open-source acoustical measurement software commonly used for measuring room acoustics, frequency response of speakers and microphones, and audio circuit characteristics. It is available for Windows, macOS, and Linux.
    </p>
    
    <h3>Calibration Process Summary</h3>
    
    <p>The following steps verify that the L-Nasality and R-Orality microphones have matched frequency responses:</p>
    
    <ol style="padding-left: 2em; margin-left: 1em;">
        <li><strong>Setup audio interface:</strong> Connect both Nosey MEMS channels to a USB audio interface with phantom power (+48V) enabled. Verify signal input in the system audio settings.</li>
        
        <li><strong>Position the device:</strong> Mount the Nosey MEMS approximately 5 cm from a loudspeaker or studio monitor in a stable position.</li>
        
        <li><strong>Run frequency sweeps:</strong> Use REW to perform frequency sweep measurements on both the L and R channels across the audible spectrum (20 Hz - 20 kHz).</li>
        
        <li><strong>Compare responses:</strong> Analyze the frequency response curves to verify that both microphones track each other closely. Well-matched microphones are essential for accurate nasalance ratio calculations.</li>
        
        <li><strong>Optional calibration:</strong> Export the frequency response data to apply correction filters to raw audio recordings before performing nasalance calculations.</li>
    </ol>
    <br>
    <p><strong>Note:</strong> For basic nasalance measurements (ratio-based), absolute SPL calibration is not required. The critical factor is that both microphones have matched relative frequency responses.</p>

    <h2>Frequency Response Testing</h2>
    
    <p>This step validates the Nosey MEMS microphones by verifying that both MEMS elements (L-Nasality and R-Orality) have matched frequency responses. Since microphones vary unit to unit, this verification ensures the device meets specifications.</p>
    
    <h3>Test Setup</h3>
    
    <p>A frequency sweep measurement is performed in REW <strong>without SPL calibration</strong>. The goal is to compare the relative frequency response between the left and right microphones, not to measure absolute sound pressure levels.</p>
    
    <div class="step">
        <h4>Performing the Sweep</h4>
        <ol style="padding-left: 2em; margin-left: 1em;">
            <li>In REW, navigate to <strong>Measure</strong> and select the configured audio interface</li>
            <li>Choose the <strong>frequency sweep</strong> measurement type</li>
            <li>Set the sweep range (typically 20 Hz - 20 kHz)</li>
            <li>Position the Nosey MEMS at a consistent distance from the studio monitors</li>
            <li>Run the measurement for both L and R channels</li>
        </ol>
    </div>
    
    <h3>Results</h3>
    
    <p>The plots below compare the frequency response of the L (orange) and R (blue) microphones with different smoothing levels applied:</p>
    
    <div class="step">
        <h4>1/1 Octave Smoothing</h4>
        <img src="img/LR_Nosey_MEMS_test_1_separated_cropped_1-1smoothing.png" alt="Frequency response with 1/1 octave smoothing" style="max-width: 100%; height: auto; border-radius: 8px; margin: 1rem 0;">
        <p>With maximum smoothing (1/1 octave), the frequency response shows:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Clear bump at ~100 Hz</strong> — likely room mode or monitor resonance</li>
            <li><strong>Significant dip at ~550 Hz</strong> — possible cancellation or room null</li>
            <li><strong>Rising response from 8 kHz onwards</strong> — common MEMS characteristic</li>
        </ul>
        <p><em>Note: The L and R traces are nearly identical, separated slightly for visibility.</em></p>
    </div>
    
    <div class="step">
        <h4>1/12 Octave Smoothing</h4>
        <img src="img/LR_Nosey_MEMS_test_1_separated_cropped_1-12smoothing.png" alt="Frequency response with 1/12 octave smoothing" style="max-width: 100%; height: auto; border-radius: 8px; margin: 1rem 0;">
        <p>With reduced smoothing (1/12 octave), additional detail becomes visible:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Peak at 100 Hz remains clear</strong></li>
            <li><strong>Dip at 550 Hz still present</strong></li>
            <li><strong>Combing artifacts from 3 kHz onwards</strong> — likely due to reflections</li>
        </ul>
        <p>The increased detail reveals environmental factors, but the L and R microphones continue to track each other remarkably well.</p>
    </div>
    
    <h3>Understanding the Imperfections</h3>
    
    <p>The frequency response deviations observed are expected given the test conditions:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Uncalibrated studio monitors</strong> — frequency production response is unknown</li>
        <li><strong>Desktop placement</strong> — monitors on the desk cause reflections and combing</li>
        <li><strong>Untreated room</strong> — no acoustic treatment or controlled environment</li>
        <li><strong>No SPL calibration</strong> — relative measurements only, not absolute levels</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h3>Interpretation</h3>
    
    <p><strong>The two MEMS microphones (L-Nasality and R-Orality) demonstrate well-matched characteristics.</strong></p>
    
    <p>Despite environmental imperfections, both microphones exhibit nearly identical frequency responses. This matching is critical for nasalometry, which calculates the <strong>ratio</strong> between nasal and oral sound energy:</p>
    
    <div class="code-block"><code>Nasalance = An / (Ao + An)</code></div>
    <br>
    
    <p>Since both microphones experience the same acoustic environment and have matched responses, room-induced anomalies affect both channels equally and cancel out in the ratio calculation.</p>
    
    <p><strong>For nasality measurements based on energy ratios, this configuration is adequate.</strong> Advanced calibration and a specialized sound booth would be required for absolute SPL measurements, but for relative nasalance calculations, the Nosey MEMS meets the necessary specifications.</p>
    
    <p class="next-step">The device is now validated and ready for its <a href="3dprinting.html#hero">3D printed parts</a>, or if using as-is, <a href="nasometry.html#hero">nasometry measurements</a>.</p>

<section id="noise-resonance" class="content-section">
    <h2>Noise Floor and Resonance Characteristics</h2>
    
    <p>Beyond frequency response matching, understanding the noise floor and self-resonance behavior of the MEMS microphones provides insight into the device's practical performance limits and acoustic characteristics.</p>
    
    <h3>Noise Floor Analysis</h3>
    
    <p>The noise floor spectrum reveals the baseline electronic noise present in the microphone system when no acoustic signal is present. Both L and R channels exhibit similar characteristics:</p>
    
    <div class="step">
        <div style="margin: 1rem 0;">
            <img src="img/audio_plots/NoseyMEMS-L-noise.png" alt="Left channel noise floor spectrum" style="max-width: 100%; height: auto; border-radius: 8px; margin-bottom: 1rem;">
            <img src="img/audio_plots/NoseyMEMS-R-noise.png" alt="Right channel noise floor spectrum" style="max-width: 100%; height: auto; border-radius: 8px;">
        </div>
        
        <p>The noise spectrum shows approximately <strong>-51 dB at 50 Hz</strong>, rolling off smoothly to <strong>-90 dB between 2-4 kHz</strong>. </p>
        <!-- <p>This performance is typical for quality MEMS microphones with low-noise preamplification. The elevated low-frequency noise is characteristic of 1/f (flicker) noise common in electronic systems, while the roll-off indicates effective high-frequency noise suppression in the signal chain. For speech nasometry applications where energy is concentrated between 300 Hz and 3 kHz, this noise floor provides excellent dynamic range.</p> -->
    </div>
    
    <!-- <h3>Self-Resonance Testing</h3>
    
    <p>To investigate potential acoustic resonances in the microphone capsules and their mounting, a feedback test was performed by bringing headphones close to the microphones until acoustic feedback occurred. While this method lacks the precision of controlled impedance tube measurements, it reveals resonant peaks in the system:</p>
    
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Left channel (L-Nasality):</strong> Primary resonance peak at <strong>4.9 kHz</strong> with fading harmonics visible around 10 kHz and 14.9 kHz</li>
        <li><strong>Right channel (R-Orality):</strong> Primary resonance peak at <strong>14.7 kHz</strong> with no clear harmonics</li>
    </ul>
    
    <p>The difference in resonant frequencies between channels is likely attributable to uncontrolled hand-held positioning of the headphones during testing rather than significant variation between the microphones themselves. To obtain a more representative characterization, averaged measurements were collected over multiple feedback instances.</p> -->
    
    <h3>Averaged Resonance Spectrum</h3>
    
    <p>Averaging the entire test session reduces the influence of transient positioning variations and reveals the consistent acoustic signature of both channels:</p>
    
    <div class="step">
        <div style="margin: 1rem 0;">
            <img src="img/audio_plots/NoseyMEMS-L-AVGresonance.png" alt="Left channel averaged resonance spectrum" style="max-width: 100%; height: auto; border-radius: 8px; margin-bottom: 1rem;">
            <img src="img/audio_plots/NoseyMEMS-R-AVGresonance.png" alt="Right channel averaged resonance spectrum" style="max-width: 100%; height: auto; border-radius: 8px;">
        </div>
        
        <p>Both channels demonstrate remarkably similar patterns:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Elevated plateau at -48 dB from 50 Hz to 500 Hz</strong> — combination of residual noise floor and low-frequency acoustic coupling</li>
            <li><strong>Roll-off to -78 dB around 2 kHz</strong> — transition from noise-dominated to resonance-dominated spectrum</li>
            <li><strong>Resonance peaks at approximately 5 kHz, 9 kHz, 15 kHz, and 21 kHz</strong> — acoustic resonances of the MEMS capsule cavity and mounting structure?</li>
        </ul>
    </div>
    
    <!-- <h3>Physical Interpretation</h3>
    
    <p>The observed resonance peaks are expected phenomena arising from the physical geometry of the MEMS microphone system. Several factors contribute to these characteristics:</p>
    
    <p><strong>MEMS Capsule Acoustics:</strong> The MEMS microphone consists of a small cavity behind the diaphragm, typically creating Helmholtz resonances in the 5-20 kHz range. These resonances are engineered into the capsule design to extend high-frequency response, which explains the rising response above 8 kHz noted in the frequency sweep measurements.</p>
    
    <p><strong>Mounting and Port Geometry:</strong> The acoustic port through which sound enters the microphone, combined with any protective mesh or windscreen, forms additional resonant structures. The multiple peaks observed (5 kHz, 9 kHz, 15 kHz, 21 kHz) suggest standing waves and cavity modes within the microphone housing and PCB-mounted structure.</p>
    
    <p><strong>Signal Chain Contribution:</strong> While the TI dual op-amp configuration (buffer + inverting buffer for balanced output) provides clean amplification with excellent CMRR (Common-Mode Rejection Ratio), it does not introduce these resonances — they are acoustic in nature. The 48V phantom power through balanced cables into the Behringer UCA404 ensures adequate headroom and low noise, allowing these subtle acoustic characteristics to be clearly resolved.</p>
    
    <p><strong>Matched Behavior:</strong> The critical finding is that both L and R channels exhibit nearly identical resonance patterns, confirming matched acoustic behavior. For nasalance ratio calculations, this matching ensures that any frequency-dependent characteristics affect both nasal and oral measurements equally, maintaining measurement accuracy across the frequency spectrum.</p>
    
    <p class="next-step">With noise floor and resonance characteristics documented, the microphones demonstrate suitable performance for speech nasometry applications where most energy lies below 5 kHz.</p> -->
